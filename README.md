No need to give credits! You can say that you made the whole thing because I don't mind. ðŸ˜€
Also, feel free to decompile this!

This is .NET Framework 4.7.2

When you're done, go to Simple Console Bootstrapper/Simple Console Bootstrapper/bin/Debug (or /Release depending on which one you built) and get the .exe file!

Unfortunately, It just downloads the file and doesn't extract any file with a zipping format.

The console is transparent because it closes really fast.
